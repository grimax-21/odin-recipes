      </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the spice mixture: Mix cinnamon, cumin, salt, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, turmeric, and curry powder together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Make the stew: Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and just beginning to brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in kale and spice mixture; cook and stir until kale begins to wilt and spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add broth, garbanzo beans, tomatoes, potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, lentils, apricots, and honey; stir to combine and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 30 to 40 minutes. Cover the pot and refrigerate for up to 3 days.</li>
        <li>When ready to eat, remove from the refrigerator and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until vegetables are tender and stew is heated through, about 25 minutes. Season with black pepper. If a thicker stew is desired, dissolve cornstarch in water. Stir mixture into stew and simmer until thickened, about 5 more minutes.</li>
    
    
    </ol>
    <h3>To Freeze:</h3>
    <p>Follow instructions through Step 4, but when cool, transfer stew to a freezer-safe container and freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to eat, thaw frozen stew in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours, then continue with Step 5 as written.</p>
    <h3>To Enjoy Immediately:</h3>
    <p>Follow instructions through Step 3. Once ingredients come to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer until vegetables and lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. Season with black pepper. If a thicker stew is desired, dissolve cornstarch in water. Stir mixture into stew and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.</p>
